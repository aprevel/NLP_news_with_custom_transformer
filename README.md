# NLP for News categories dataset

This repository contains a short notebook showing how to predict an article category by using NLP techniques. 
The package I used for lemmatization is Spacy, and the rest of the pipeline is based on Sklearn.

I implemented a **custom transformer** to process separately two textual variables.
